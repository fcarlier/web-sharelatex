							h2 ShareLaTeX Dropbox Sync
							p  LaTeX and Dropbox has never been easier
							p.subdued ShareLaTeX allows you to link your account
								| to Dropbox, keeping your LaTeX work synced at all
								| times. Using LaTeX in a team is made easier with
								| dropbox allowing your team members to use their own
								| tools, and work offline if required. With all of
								| your LaTeX synced to dropbox you never have to worry
								| about keeping backups of your ShareLaTeX work again.

							h2 Work Offline
							p.subdued Dropbox Sync allows you to work on your
								| LaTeX offline using Dropbox, then come back to the
								| updated project in ShareLaTeX, just like you never
								| left. Being on the move with no internet connection
								| no longer means you can not work on your LaTeX
								| project, and Dropbox's great offline capabilities
								| allows you to use local editors then let Dropbox and
								| ShareLaTeX take care of the rest.

							h2 Collaborate with Anyone 
							p.subdued Not everyone wants to use ShareLaTeX, and
								| sharing your LaTeX files via Dropbox allows you to
								| collaborate with people who like to use a different
								| editor. Many people have been using LaTeX for
								| decades and do not want to move away from the tools
								| they know so well, but this no longer has to be a reason
								| to stop you working on a paper with them

							h2 LaTeX Backups in Dropbox
							p.subdued All of your LaTeX files will be safely
								| stored in Dropbox so you no longer have to worry
